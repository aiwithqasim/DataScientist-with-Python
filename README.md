# DATA SCIENTIST WITH PYTHON
I don't wanna tell you here what is Data Science? Just telling you one Motivational point that according to <em>statista</em> Data Science is an sexiest job of 2021 and In 4th industrial revolution is maximum work is on Artificial intelligence, DeepLearning, Machine Learning and thses kind of buzz words.If you still want to know more you can read My these articles given below:

## Class 01 Introduction to python
Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming ever more popular for data science. Companies worldwide are using Python to harvest insights from their data and gain a competitive edge. Unlike other Python tutorials, this Notebook focuses on Python specifically for data science. In our Introduction to Python course, you’ll learn about powerful ways to store and manipulate data, and helpful data science tools to begin conducting your own analyses.

## Class 02 Intermediate Python
Learning Python is crucial for any aspiring data science practitioner. Learn to visualize real data with Matplotlib's functions and get acquainted with data structures such as the dictionary and the pandas DataFrame. After covering key concepts such as boolean logic, control flow, and loops in Python, you'll be ready to blend together everything you've learned to solve a case study using hacker statistics.

## class 03 Data manipulation with Pandas
pandas is the world's most popular Python library, used for everything from data manipulation to data analysis. In this Notebook, you'll learn how to manipulate DataFrames, as you extract, filter, and transform real-world datasets for analysis. Using pandas you’ll explore all the core data science concepts. Using real-world data, including Walmart sales figures and global temperature time series, you’ll learn how to import, clean, calculate statistics, and create visualizations—using pandas to add to the power of Python!

## class 04 Joining data with Pandas
Being able to combine and work with multiple datasets is an essential skill for any aspiring Data Scientist. pandas is a crucial cornerstone of the Python data science ecosystem, with Stack Overflow recording 5 million views for pandas questions. Learn to handle multiple DataFrames by combining, organizing, joining, and reshaping them using pandas. You'll work with datasets from the World Bank and the City Of Chicago. You will finish the course with a solid skillset for data-joining in pandas.
