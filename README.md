## class 05 Introduction to matplotlib
Visualizing data in plots and figures exposes the underlying patterns in the data and provides insights. Good visualizations also help you communicate your data to others, and are useful to data analysts and other consumers of the data. In this class , you will learn how to use Matplotlib, a powerful Python data visualization library. Matplotlib provides the building blocks to create rich visualizations of many different kinds of datasets. You will learn how to create visualizations for different kinds of data and how to customize, automate, and share these visualizations.

## class 06 Introduction to seaborn
Seaborn is a powerful Python library that makes it easy to create informative and attractive visualizations. These seabornn Notebooks provides an introduction to Seaborn and teaches you how to visualize your data using plots such as scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots. You’ll do this while exploring survey responses about student hobbies and the factors that are associated with academic success. You’ll also learn about some of Seaborn’s advantages as a statistical visualization tool, such as how it automatically calculates confidence intervals. By the end of the notebooks, you will be able to use Seaborn in a variety of situations to explore your data and effectively communicate the results of your data analyses to others.

## Python data Sciencce ToolBox
It's time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are tons of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a data scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. You will learn the art of function writing in this first Python Data Science Toolbox course. You'll come out of these Notebooks being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice. And you'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames.

In this second Python Data Science Toolbox Notebook, you'll continue to build your Python data science skills. First, you'll learn about iterators, objects you have already encountered in the context of for loops. You'll then learn about list comprehensions, which are extremely handy tools for all data scientists working in Python. You'll end the Notebook by working through a case study in which you'll apply all the techniques you learned in both parts of this Notebook "Bringing it all together!"
